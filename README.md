# The-Gaming-Room---Draw-It-or-Lose-It
Southern New Hampshire University CS230 Operating Systems Class Project

<b>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</b>  
	Our new client The Gaming Room, wants to develop a web-based game that can be available on multiple platforms. They want to base it on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is itself loosely based on the 1980s game show Win, Lose, or Draw. While Draw It or Lose It is currently only available as an Android app, the company also wants the new game to be able to run on multiple platforms, which can include Windows, MacOS, Linux, ChromeOS, and mobile devices such as iOS, Android, and Windows. 

<b>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</b>  
  I believe I was able to identify what the client wanted and give the strengths and drawbacks of various aspects that must be considered for development. A thorough point-by-point review of the strengths and weaknesses gives both the client and development team a better handle on what is needed for development.
  
<b>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</b>  
	It helped to aid in keeping my focus on the task at hand and to decide on what tasks are most important and need to be focused on first. It also helped me to understand what I personally needed to focus on, what my strengths and weaknesses are as far as project design and coding.
	
<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b>  
	I would like to have been more knowledgable about Linux development. Working through this helped me to realize how powerful it is. With more knowledge and understanding, I could have made better recommendations with the understanding of why I would make them.
	
<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b>  
	User experience is important because it tries to fulfill the user's needs. It aims to provide positive experiences that keep a user loyal to the product or brand. Additionally, a meaningful user experience allows you to define customer journeys on your product that are most conducive to business success. The user needs to have a user-friendly interface but without the application taking up permanent resources on the machine. Using cloud servers and REST APIs helps to bring the user a smooth and secure experience.
	
<b>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</b>  
	I put my focus on clear documentation and separating the different game functionality into different classes to allow easier updates and maintenence. Using object oriented programming techniques will help for any type of similar software application that uses similar principles. As an example, having a template code for REST API will allow for portability to any project that would use REST API, followed by tailoring the code to fit the new project.
